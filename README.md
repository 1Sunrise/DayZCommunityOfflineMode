This build is slightly improved in some aspects. Such as:
1) Custom character in new clothes and weapons.
2) Disabled the parameter "Autorun" on the key "X". Because the parameter conflicts with switching the shooting mode in the game. This parameter can be restored if desired.
3) Slightly improved the code and appeared hints. That is, now you can create your own custom character and also weapons to him.
